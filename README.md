## About
I’m a **Computer Science and Computational Mathematics double major** at Brooklyn College, with minors in Data Science and Statistics.  
Passionate about **machine learning, data science, and quantitative research**, I’ve gained experience at **Microsoft Research (DS3)**, **KPMG AI Studio**, and **Uber Career Prep**.  

💡 **Fun Fact:** I drink way too much tea while coding, it’s basically my debugging fuel.
